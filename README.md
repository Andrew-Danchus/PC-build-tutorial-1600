## **Required Tools and components**

### **Tools** 

-Phillips-head screwdriver
-(optional) Anti-static wrist guard (to ensure parts aren't damaged from static electricity - avoid building on carpet)
-(optional) zip ties (If you're lazy and unorganized like me, you can disregard this)
    -Scissors (if you opt to use zipties)

    
### **Components** 
###I would reccomend using a site like [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/), it will allow you to sort thruogh parts by price, and technical capabilities, also it will point out any incompatibilities with your selected components.

-Case  
-Motherboard 
-CPU
-CPU Cooler
-RAM
-Storage (I would reccomend an SSD)
-Graphics Card
-Power Supply (Make sure it is strong enough for your componenets)
-Operating system (Install it onto an external drive, there will usually be a version to install on the OS developers website - you will need to purchase a key for some features)
## **Step-by-Step assembly 

### **Install the CPU**
1. Open the CPU socket on the motherboard (examine motherboard manual if you are unsure where it is)
2. Align the CPU with the socket(there will be a triangle usually on the bottom left corner)![triangle](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Fix+Bent+CPU+Pins/140367)
3. Gently place the CPU into the socket, and close it once it is secure.

### **Attatch the CPU cooler**
1. Apply a small amount of themral paste to the CPU inside the socket. (Most new coolers have thermal paste pre-applied)
2. Attatch the cooler to the CPU and screw in the brackets. (Follow the manual, the insallation process varies by product.)

### **Install RAM**
1. Open the RAM slots on the Motherboard

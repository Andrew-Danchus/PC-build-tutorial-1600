## **Required Tools and components**

### **Tools** 

-Phillips-head screwdriver
-(optional) Anti-static wrist guard (to ensure parts aren't damaged from static electricity - avoid building on carpet)
-(optional) zip ties (If you're lazy and unorganized like me, you can disregard this)
    -Scissors (if you opt to use zipties)

    
### **Components**

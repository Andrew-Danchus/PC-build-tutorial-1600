## **Required Tools and components**

### **Tools** 

-Phillips-head screwdriver
-(optional) Anti-static wrist guard (to ensure parts aren't damaged from static electricity - avoid building on carpet)
-(optional) zip ties (If you're lazy and unorganized like me, you can disregard this)
    -Scissors (if you opt to use zipties)

    
### **Components** 
###I would recommend using a site like [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/), it will allow you to sort thruogh parts by price, and technical capabilities, also it will point out any incompatibilities with your selected components.

-Case  
-Motherboard 
-CPU
-CPU Cooler
-RAM
-Storage (I would recommend an SSD if you are looking for efficiency)
-Graphics Card
-Power Supply (Make sure it is strong enough for your componenets)
-Operating system (Install it onto an external drive, there will usually be a version to install on the OS developers website - you will need to purchase a key for some features)

## **Step-by-Step assembly**

### I would recommend reading the manuals and installation guides provided with each component, because many of the specific instructions vary by manufacturer. 

### **Install the CPU**
1. Open the CPU socket on the motherboard. (examine motherboard manual if you are unsure where it is)
2. Align the CPU with the socket. (there will be a triangle usually on the bottom left corner)![triangle](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Fix+Bent+CPU+Pins/140367)
3. Gently place the CPU into the socket, and close it once it is secure.

### **Attatch the cooler**
1. Apply a small amount of themral paste to the CPU inside the socket. (Most new coolers have thermal paste pre-applied)
2. Attatch the cooler to the CPU and screw in the brackets. (Follow the manual, the insallation process varies by product)

### **Install RAM**
1. Open the RAM slots on the Motherboard.
2. Align the notch on the RAM stick with the slot.
3. Press the RAM stick into place until it clicks, usually the slot will close when it is secure.

### **Mount the Motherboard** 
1. Install the motherboard standoffs in the case.
2. Align the motherboard with the standoffs.
3. Secure the motherboard to the standoffs with the screws.

### **Install Storage**
1. Mount the SSD or HHD in the appropriate slot. (If it is in NVMe drive it will need to be secured in the NVm.e slot on the mother board)
2. Connect the SATA or NVMe connector.

### **Install Power Supply**
1. Secure power supply in the case
2. Connect the main power cables to the motherboard and other components.

### **Connecting the Cables**
-24-pin cable motherboard to the motherboard. 
-CPU power cable.
-SATA cables for the storage drives.
-GPU power cable

## **Final Checks**

-Ensure every component is secured in their respective socket.
- Verify the necessary cables are connected and secure
-Ensure there are no obstructions.

## **Powering-on**
### Finally you can boot the PC which you have just so stressfully worked on, here are the steps you need for the First-time boot.

1. Connect your pc to the peripheral devices (keyboard, mouse, monitor)
2. Turn on the power supply by flipping the switch on the back, then press the power button on the case.
3. Enter BIOS to ensure components are detected.
4. Plug in the external drive with the OS installed.
5. Let the software install, and configure your new PC.

## **Troubleshooting Tips**
### Building a PC for the first time cna be a stressful process, its easy to make small mistakes and not notice. The first PC I built couldn't boot to BIOS becaues the PC didn't have my keyboard drivers installed, it happens to the best of us. Here are a few tips in the case teh PC doesn't start:
- Recheck the cable connections
- Verify the RAM and GPU are seated properly: the computer will not be able to boot without these components.
- Look for error lights on the motherboard: the motherboard may light up while malfunctioning, around the light it will say which port or component it is.
